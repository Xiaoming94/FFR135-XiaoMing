    \begin{tabular}{|c c|c|}
        \hline
        $v_1$ & $v_2$ & \cellcolor{gray!25}$f(v_1,v_2)$\\
        \hline 
        0 & 0 & 0 \\
        0 & 1 & 1 \\
        1 & 0 & 1 \\
        1 & 1 & 0 \\
        \hline

\end{table}    

Every boolean function can be described using a truth table, which maps a unique combination of 1s and 0s (or true or false) to a boolean output. An example is the one in table \ref{tab:xor}.

In the case of 3-dimensional boolean functions that takes $v_1,v_2,\text{ and }v_3$ as input will thus get $2^3 = 8$ unique inputs. Since one unique input combination of true and false (1s and 0s) can be mapped to either true or false, the boolean function can thus be described as a 8 dimensional boolean vector. From this reasoning, it is trivial to see that there are $2^8 = 256$ Possible 3-dimensional boolean functions.
